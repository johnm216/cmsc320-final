Data Analysis of Homicide Reports for the US

Do you know how months of the year and murders correlate to one another? Using information made available by the Murder Accountability Project we can attempt to answer this question. We will begin by showing you how to import this data into your R Markdown file and then put it into machine readable form. Then we will show you how to process the data and do some exploratory analysis and visualization in order to create your hypotheses for the data. Next, we will show you how to test these hypotheses using machine learning.
